# MLND Capstone - Starbucks Challenge

## Overview
During a 30-day simulation, Starbucks sends out 10 different offers to its 17,000 customers. The transactions made by customers and offer related activities are recorded. The goal of this project is twofold: 

1. to analyze the customer's attitude towards a received promotional offer;
2. to build a classifier to predict whether a customer likes an offer based on attributes of customer and offer. 

## Packages
The project is developed under Python 3.7 with the following packages:

* pandas
* NumPy
* scikit-learn
* LightGBM
* seaborn
* tabulate
* tqdm
